Implementing Regression Analysis on Car Price Dataset In Python

I used cars price data set and perform the linear Regression technique to predict 
the price of the car.
In this study, I performed exploratory data analysis to get a better understanding of the data, 
and then I examined the Linear Regression to predict the price of new cars. I discovered that cars 
that have been produced by BMW and Buick companies were the most expensive cars. And cars 
with diesel fuel type, turbo aspiration, two-door number, hatchback body, rear engine location, and 
eight-cylinder number were the most expensive cars as well. Also, there was a strong correlation 
between price and car length, car width, curb weight, engine size, horsepower, city mpg, and 
highway mpg attributes. Finally, I performed a linear Regression with 95% accuracy. The three 
most significant variables were engine size, front engine location, BMW, and Buick Company 
name. Also, the Buick Company name had the greatest positive influence on car prices among these 
features.
